## 💭 Abstract
When we were assigned this project, the goal was to give ourselves a take home assignment similar to how a job interview may give you home "homework" to do to show you know your stuff. To this end, I purposely abbreviated the time I spent on this and gave a very stripped back app to meet the project spec.

## 💻 Installation instructions
1. Open project on Github
2. Clone down the repo
3. cd into the repo and run npm install
4. Run npm start
5. Think of what articles you want to search up.
6. type articles into search bar and click search. Several articles should appear, click one to see more information

## 🍎 Context
This was a news reading app I built over the course of a few hours as a stretch of my abilities and to see wHat I would be able to put out after a break from coding for a few days.

## 🎆 Wins && 🔥 Challenges#
### Wins:
Getting the articles to populate with the search function when hooked up to the API was a huge win!

### Challenges: 
The biggest challenge I had with this project was understanding how to use the API. I am very thankful for the documentation that I ended up reading and then rereading several times. 

## 📝 Observations  
I was very surprised at how quickly this project was able to happen. I thought it was a pretty big ask but then I did it in only a few hours. Strict adherence to the project spec meant there was no testing or pretty formatting to be done so I think that majorly cut down on the time I spent.
